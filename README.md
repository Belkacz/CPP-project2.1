### About 

The program is used to store rainfall amounts for each month.

For testing purposes, we assume that the rainfall is initially random, and the amount of rainfall in a given month can be in the range of <0, 10> with a step of 0.1 (e.g., 9.9, 4.1, 0).

The program allows for calculating the total rainfall for each year, calculating the annual average rainfall, and calculating the average for a specific month.

It displays the months and years with the highest rainfall, indicating if any repetitions occur.

The program also provides the ability to correct data, including date ranges and specific rainfall values.

By default, the data is generated for the years 2018-2022, but this can be changed.
